1. I worked on this project independently. I used internet searches throughout to help me fix bugs as well as learn the process.

2. One issue I came across in this project was in Step 7, trying to join the tables. Having two tables with the same variables
initially created some confusion for the compiler as I forgot to specify exactly which attributes should go where.
I overcame this problem by thoroughly making sure I hade the right data being sent to the right locations.

3. I liked that is was Harry Potter themed! I also liked that I had some previous background in the data so it wasn't totally unfamiliar.
I liked that his project had enough data to illustrate some key points but not so much to be overwhelming. 
I also liked how this project demonstrated some of the emergent issues that come up in data bases.

4. I probably spent around 3 hours on this assignment, trying to learn the concepts, and also because the first time I started
working on this I had just been to the eye doctor and my eyes were dilated.
