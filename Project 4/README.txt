1. I worked on this project independently.

2. One of the buggest challenges I faced was with multiplicity in some of the more complex queries. I surmounted them by writing out my queries on a whiteboard and following the algortithm for teh quiery step-by-step. I also faced a challenge in that in Problem 9, when I wrote a subquiery to return Gilderoy Lockhearts start and ending year, it would return the column with no entries. I thought this was strange. I overcame this challenge by removing that part and instead just checking for the years since I felt like this was a reasonable thing to do given we could easily find the data even if it didn't generalize well, it still answers the problem, and in a "real_world" setting one might do something similar.

3. I liked working with the Hogwarts data. That being said, it makes it a little harder to see individual queries we are preforming in a more abstract or general setting (i.e., one where we might actually use SQL in a job or something).

4. I probably spent 2-3 hours on this assignment.
