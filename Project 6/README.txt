1) I worked on this project independently, but with LOTS of assistance from Stack Exchange.

2) I came across many challenges in this assignment. First was decoding the ERD and setting up appropriate
Tables. The deciding on what data types to have the columns of the table to be. I made q few iterations
of the tables that I wanted and kept editing them as I got further into the project and realized that data
types I had selected for certain attributes would not pair well with how they were currently being sotred
in the data base. Once I had my tables made, populating them with data was a serious challenge.
I tried many things and it took A LOT of trial and error. I emailed CPW when I was struggling with this step
and he gave me a hint that helped me populate the artist table. Once I had that finished, it gave me a template
for how to think about going about populating the rest of the tables, which by no means was a trivial task.
After that stage though, querying against my database wasn't so bad and it was nice to see that what I had made
was working properly.

3) I liked that it gave the experience of building a database from scratch. It was hard for me.
It was the first time in the course we've had to deal with "real"-ish data with lots of nulls, redundancy, etc.
I didn't like that I had nothing the go off of. To be honest I felt a little unprepared to take on this assignment
but nevertheless I managed. It would have been nice to go through a similar process with a smaller database 
in class though. I also like the music choice that CPW selected for this assignment. The Who, Led Zeppelin, Talking Heads,
Chris Thile, Massive Attack: all great choices. Perhaps next time include some Phish and Grateful Dead!
