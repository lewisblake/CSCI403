1. I worked on this project independently. I had to Google some things like DISTINCT and ORDER BY
because we had not covered them in class at the time I was completing the assignment.

2. One of the biggest challenges I came across as with JOINS. At first it returned a Cartesian product
so I had a closer look at my query and realized I made a mistake. Once that was fixed the rest was good.

3. I liked that the problems were vague enough as to indicate a solution but not give one away.
The questions were also ones someone might intuitively come up with in a "real-world" setting.
